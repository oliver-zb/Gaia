%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v6.2 LaTeX 2e macros.
%%
%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls 
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.

%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls (http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/) and
%% other external packages (latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable, and epsf).
%% All of these external packages should already be present in the modern TeX 
%% distributions.  If not they can also be obtained at www.ctan.org.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The 
%% documentclass can take an optional argument to modify the output style.
%% The command below calls the preprint style  which will produce a tightly 
%% typeset, one-column, single-spaced document.  It is the default and thus
%% does not need to be explicitly stated.
%%
%%
%% using aastex version 6.2
\documentclass{aastex62}

%% The default is a single spaced, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%% There are 5 other style options available via an optional argument. They
%% can be envoked like this:
%%
%% \documentclass[argument]{aastex62}
%% 
%% where the layout options are:
%%
%%  twocolumn   : two text columns, 10 point font, single spaced article.
%%                This is the most compact and represent the final published
%%                derived PDF copy of the accepted manuscript from the publisher
%%  manuscript  : one text column, 12 point font, double spaced article.
%%  preprint    : one text column, 12 point font, single spaced article.  
%%  preprint2   : two text columns, 12 point font, single spaced article.
%%  modern      : a stylish, single text column, 12 point font, article with
%% 		  wider left and right margins. This uses the Daniel
%% 		  Foreman-Mackey and David Hogg design.
%%  RNAAS       : Preferred style for Research Notes which are by design 
%%                lacking an abstract and brief. DO NOT use \begin{abstract}
%%                and \end{abstract} with this style.
%%
%% Note that you can submit to the AAS Journals in any of these 6 styles.
%%
%% There are other optional arguments one can envoke to allow other stylistic
%% actions. The available options are:
%%
%%  astrosymb    : Loads Astrosymb font and define \astrocommands. 
%%  tighten      : Makes baselineskip slightly smaller, only works with 
%%                 the twocolumn substyle.
%%  times        : uses times font instead of the default
%%  linenumbers  : turn on lineno package.
%%  trackchanges : required to see the revision mark up and print its output
%%  longauthor   : Do not use the more compressed footnote style (default) for 
%%                 the author/collaboration/affiliations. Instead print all
%%                 affiliation information after each name. Creates a much
%%                 long author list but may be desirable for short author papers
%%
%% these can be used in any combination, e.g.
%%
%% \documentclass[twocolumn,linenumbers,trackchanges]{aastex62}
%%
%% AASTeX v6.* now includes \hyperref support. While we have built in specific
%% defaults into the classfile you can manually override them with the
%% \hypersetup command. For example,
%%
%%\hypersetup{linkcolor=red,citecolor=green,filecolor=cyan,urlcolor=magenta}
%%
%% will change the color of the internal links to red, the links to the
%% bibliography to green, the file links to cyan, and the external links to
%% magenta. Additional information on \hyperref options can be found here:
%% https://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/manual.html#x1-40003

%% If you want to create your own macros, you can do so
%% using \newcommand. Your macros should appear before
%% the \begin{document} command.

	%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
	%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
	%% you desire. In v6.2 you can include a footnote in the title.
	
	%% A significant change from earlier AASTEX versions is in the structure for 
	%% calling author and affilations. The change was necessary to implement 
	%% autoindexing of affilations which prior was a manual process that could 
	%% easily be tedious in large author manuscripts.
	%%
	%% The \author command is the same as before except it now takes an optional
	%% arguement which is the 16 digit ORCID. The syntax is:
	%% \author[xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx]{Author Name}
	%%
	%% This will hyperlink the author name to the author's ORCID page. Note that
	%% during compilation, LaTeX will do some limited checking of the format of
	%% the ID to make sure it is valid.
	%%
	%% Use \affiliation for affiliation information. The old \affil is now aliased
	%% to \affiliation. AASTeX v6.2 will automatically index these in the header.
	%% When a duplicate is found its index will be the same as its previous entry.
	%%
	%% Note that \altaffilmark and \altaffiltext have been removed and thus 
	%% can not be used to document secondary affiliations. If they are used latex
	%% will issue a specific error message and quit. Please use multiple

	%%
	%% The new \altaffiliation can be used to indicate some secondary information
	%% such as fellowships. This command produces a non-numeric footnote that is
	%% set away from the numeric \affiliation footnotes.  NOTE that if an
	%% \altaffiliation command is used it must come BEFORE the \affiliation call,
	%% right after the \author command, in order to place the footnotes in
	%% the proper location.
	%%
	%% Use \email to set provide email addresses. Each \email will appear on its
	%% own line so you can put multiple email address in one \email call. A new

	%% to make sure this name is also in the author list.
	%%
	%% While authors can be grouped inside the same \author and \affiliation

	\noindent
	Two main questions will be asked and answered in this manuscript using data of the \textit{Gaia} DR2 \citep{gaiamission, Gaia, gaiaagain}. 1: What is the mean motion of stars in the solar neighbourhood, and do the velocities depend on temperature (section \ref{localkin}) ? 2: Is there an easy way to determine the Local Standard of Rest (LSR) that gives similar results compared to other methods (section \ref{lsr}) ? The results that were found are that the velocities of the stars are constant for temperatures below $5800\rm K$, but with significant changes in the high temperature area. We found a very simple method to determine the LSR. The calculated velocities are $\left( U, V, W\right)_\odot=\left(11.92\pm1.17, 11.87\pm0.72, 6.44\pm0.46\right)\rm
	km~s^{-1}$, which is in agreement to literature.

	\section{Introduction}
	\noindent
	The amount of data provided by the \textit{Gaia} mission is significantly larger than previous data sets. Therefore it makes sense to study stellar motions based on much more values with better statistics. 
	\noindent
	In the first part of this chapter, we want to find out something about the motion of stars close to our Sun. Because of the gravitational potential of all objects in the Milky Way, stars cross the disk vertically in an oscillating motion as well as they do in radial direction, towards and away from the galactic centre. Because all stars are assumed to follow such motions, this should result in a statistically steady state. In particular we want to find out if these motions depend on temperature.
	\\
	In the second part, we want to determine the local standard of rest, the mean motion of the disk material in the solar neighbourhood.
	
	\section{Data selection \& Data transformation} 
	\noindent
	The starting point is the part of the \textit{Gaia} DR2 containing information about radial velocities. Since we are interested in the solar neighborhood, only objects closer than $100\rm pc$ are considered. Furthermore, all stars with either $\frac{\sigma_{\alpha^*}}{\alpha^*}$,$\frac{\sigma_{\delta}}{\delta}$ or $\frac{\sigma_{\bar{\omega}}}{\bar{\omega}}$ larger than $0.1$, $\sigma_{v_{rad}}\leq$ $|5|$ $\rm km~s^{-1}$ as well as the ones with temperatures above $7000\rm K$ are neglected.
	\\
	To obtain the velocities from the data, $\mu_{\alpha^*}$, $\mu_{\delta}$ and $v_{rad}$ are transformed to Cartesian coordinates using
	
	\begin{equation}
	\vec{v}_{Equat} = 
	\left(
	\begin{array}{c}
	v_x\\
	v_y\\
	v_z
	\end{array}
	\right) =
	\left(
	\begin{array}{c}
	rv \cos{(\alpha)} \cos{(\delta)} - d k \mu_{\alpha*} \cos{(\alpha)} \sin{(\delta)} - d k \mu_{\delta} \sin{(\alpha)}\\
	rv \sin{(\alpha)} \cos{(\delta)} - d k  \mu_{\delta} \sin{(\alpha)} \sin{(\delta)} + d k \mu_{\alpha*} \cos{(\alpha)}\\
	rv \sin{(\delta)} + d k \mu_{\delta} \cos{(\delta)}
	\end{array}
	\right),	
	\end{equation}
	
	\noindent
	in $\rm km~s^{-1}$ where $d$ is the distance (parallax$^{-1}$), and $k$ was introduced to transform $\rm au~yr^{-1}$ to $\rm km~s^{-1}$. These velocities in Equatorial coordinates are then transformed to Galactic coordinates, as shown in the documentation of the \textit{Gaia} DR2 documentation \citep{documentation} using 
	
	\begin{equation}
	\quad \left(\begin{array}{c} U \\ V \\ W \end{array}\right)_\odot = \mathbf{\textit{A}}{'}_{G} \cdot \vec{v}_{Equat}.
	\end{equation}
	
	\noindent
	$\mathbf{\textit{A}}{'}_{G}$ is a transformation matrix,
	
	\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
	\mathbf{\textit{A}}{'}_{G}&=\mathbf{\textit{R}}_{z}(-l_{\Omega})\mathbf{\textit{R}}_{x}(90^\circ-\delta_G)\mathbf{\textit{R}}_z(\alpha_G+90^\circ)\\
	&=
	\left(
	\begin{array}{cccc}
	-0.0548755604162154& -0.8734370902348850& -0.4838350155487132\\
	0.4941094278755837& -0.4448296299600112& 0.7469822444972189\\
	-0.8676661490190047& -0.1980763734312015& 0.4559837761750669
	\end{array}
	\right), 
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	
	\noindent
	where $\alpha_G=192^\circ.85948$ and $\delta_G=27^\circ.12825$ define the north galactic pole and $l_\Omega=32^\circ.93192$ is the node of the galactic plane on the equator as described in \citep{coords}.
	
	\section{Local kinematics} \label{localkin}
	\noindent
	Stars similar to our Sun are confined to a thin disk, orbiting the center of the Galaxy \citep{keel}. At the moment, our solar system is located very close to this galactic plane. But it is not at rest, because of the gravitational potential of all objects in the Milky Way. Stars cross the disk in an oscillating motion as well as they do in radial direction. Because all stars are assumed to follow such motions, this should result in a statistically steady state \citep{tayler}. Only stars with a temperature between $3400\rm K$ and $7600\rm K$ were examined because there is not enough data outside this range. The stars were grouped by temperature $T_i=(3400+i\cdot200)\rm K$, where each group contained all objects that satisfy $T_i-100\rm K<T_{star}<T_i+100\rm K$. Then, the mean values for each component of $\left( U, V, W\right)$ were calculated for each temperature-bin. The result can be found in figure \ref{fig:lsrmean}. As one can see, U and W are approximately constant over almost the entire temperature scale. We also note a significant decrease of V at $5800\rm K$, and that its values are less constant for temperatures below. However, the differences are less than $3\rm km~s^{-1}$. It is interesting to see that the motions of the stars seem to have a temperature-independent behavior over $2400\rm K$. It would be interesting to see if the stars keep to change their velocities as they tend to for the highest temperatures. But we have no information in this area, more data is needed.

	\section{Local Standard of Rest} \label{lsr}
	\noindent
	In this section we want to determine the LSR. It is defined to follow the mean motion of the disk material in the solar neighbourhood \citep{shu}. Because disk material is not only the stars, but also gas, and dust, we cannot just take all the values found for the local kinematics. As already mentioned, our aim is to find a trivial way to determine the LSR. The idea is the following: Hotter stars have a shorter lifetime than colder ones. Therefore, we assume that they are in average younger than colder stars. Because stars are created in gas clouds, which can also be found in galactic disks, and the assumption that these stars are young, their mean velocities should be close to the one of the gas contained in the disk. Therefore, we look at the velocities of high temperature stars. As can be seen in table \ref{tab:vel}, the highest temperature with sufficient data is $6800\rm K$ with $\left( U, V, W\right)_\odot=\left( 11.92\pm1.17, 11.87\pm0.72, 6.44\pm0.46 \right)\rm km~s^{-1}$.
	\\
	\\
	There are many ways of determining the LSR, we will now compare our results with some that were determined in the past.
	\\
	$\,(U,V,W)_\odot=(11.1^{+0.69}_{-0.75}, 12.24^{+0.47}_{-0.47}, 7.25^{+0.37}_{-0.36})\rm km~s^{-1}$ \citep{schoenrich},
	\\
	$\,(U,V,W)_\odot=(8.16\pm0.48, 11.19\pm0.56, 8.55\pm0.48)\rm km~s^{-1}$ \citep{boby},
	\\
	$(U,V,W)_\odot=(14.1\pm1.1, 14.6\pm0.4, 6.9\pm0.1)\rm km~s^{-1}$ 	\citep{anotherlsr},
	\\
	$(U,V,W)_\odot=(8.63\pm0.64, 4.76\pm0.49, 7.26\pm0.36)\rm km~s^{-1}$ \citep{ding}.
	\\
	One can see that our values are within uncertainties when we compare them with \textit{Sch\"onrich et al.} which probably enjoys the highest acceptance. However, these values are by far the oldest ones listed here. The other publications listed are based on much more recent data which are probably more accurate. As one can see, there is not really a consensus in these results. All values for $W_\odot$ are within $2\rm km~s^{-1}$, but it is not clear how the results for $U_\odot$ and $V_\odot$ should be interpreted.

	\section{Conclusion}
	\noindent
	It was shown that the motion of stars near our solar system is nearly independent of temperature for stars with T$\leq 5800\rm K$. At this temperature, $V_\odot$ drops significantly. Since there are not enough data on the high-temperature area, it is not possible to make predictions how velocities change there.
	\\
	As shown in section \ref{lsr}, recent results of the LSR are not consistent. Therefore, it is not clear if we really have found a simple but robust way to determine the LSR. If it turns out that the results from \textit{Sch\"onrich et al.} are still valid, it would be interesting to test our method again, once there is more data accessible for stars with temperatures above $6800\rm K$.
