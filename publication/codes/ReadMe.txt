Title: A new estimate of the Local Standard of Rest using Gaia Radial Velocity Survey
Authors: O.Zbinden & P. Saha

Description of contents: This package contains two python files. To be able to use them, one has to download the data containing information of radial velocities from the Gaia website, 
http://cdn.gea.esac.esa.int/Gaia/gdr2/gaia_source_with_rv/csv/
and save them in a folder named data (or make small adaptations in both python files if desired). One has to execute the file load_data.py first, which reads the data contained in the .csv files that were downloaded from the website. After this is done, one can run lsr_pub.py to get the plot that can be found in the publication and the numerical values.

System requirements: no special requirements

Additional comments: We know that there are much faster methods to read the source data and the reader is free to use such a method.
